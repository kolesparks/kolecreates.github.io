                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I spend an insane amount of time on the computer and have
                    for many years. I find software deeply facinating. I feel
                    that there are secrets still hidden within the nature of
                    computing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, computing is just a piece of the puzzle. The world
                    is an integrated system - no part isn't of at least some
                    interest to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most important is my wife Anna, Mr. Moose, Calvin, and our
                    family and friends.

                <h2>Software Patents</h2>
                <p>Posted Aug 22, 2024</p>

                <p>Good, Bad, or Ugly</p>

                <p>
                    Recently came across a software company with over a dozen
                    patent numbers listed at the bottom of their website. In
                    looking at a few I noticed a pattern.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The patent filing includes a beefy PDF specification thats
                    around 40 pages long. The core idea is usually captured by
                    the abstract and perhaps a single diagram. The rest of the
                    PDF is filled in with many different use case examples,
                    variations of the same diagram, and pages of text explaining
                    each diagram.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most importantly I noticed that the core idea is very
                    high-level. The specification is NOT nearly enough
                    instruction to develop the actual thing. It takes
                    considerable time and technical effort to take one of these
                    ideas and create an actual working system.
                </p>

                <p>So i'm left wondering:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Do these patents exist to protect ideas that would
                            otherwise be too easy to "steal" or re-invent
                            independently?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Is the idea worth more than the implementation?
                            Perhaps, but implementation is hard, and there's
                            almost always multiple ways of doing it, each way
                            with pros and cons over others. There's so much room
                            for competition just within implementation of the
                            same idea.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If I were to build a system similar to the one
                            described in one of these patents - where is the
                            line of infringement? What can be similar and what
                            must be different?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </article>

                <p>Posted on August 17th, 2024</p>

                <p>Solve puzzles - make money.</p>

                <p>
                    I discover the
                    <a href="https://arcprize.org/play" target="_blank"
                        >ARC-AGI challenge</a
                    >
                    a couple months ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a challenging series of puzzles with human scores
                    around 80% while the state-of-the-art algorithm has achieved
                    only 43% as of August 2024.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    ARC-AGI is explicitly designed to compare artificial
                    intelligence with human intelligence. To do this, ARC-AGI
                    explicitly lists the priors knowledge human have to provide
                    a fair ground for comparing AI systems. These core knowledge
                    priors are ones that humans naturally possess, even in
                    childhood. ... ARC-AGI avoids a reliance on any information
                    that isn’t part of these priors, for example acquired or
                    cultural knowledge, like language.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Discovering ARC-AGI reminded me of a thought experiment I
                    was obsessed with a few years ago. An idea of "Universl
                    Econimic Value".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Adjacent to universal basic income (UBI), UEV is where there
                    is some way to capitilize on the basic value of human
                    intelligence to give everyone some baseline economic worth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Physical labor is UEV historically, but we observe how wages
                    stagnate while costs explode, and we also observe how labor,
                    of all types, becomes automated overtime.
                </p>

                <p>
                    ARC-AGI rekindled the idea by demonstrating there is still
                    some fundamental disparity between human and machine
                    intelligence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What if any human could earn a wage by completing small
                    cognitive tasks within a larger information system.
                    Similarly to how car manufacturing pipelines work - where
                    there are big complicated machines doing large portions -
                    alongside humans doing smaller more intricate segments.

                <p>
                    Like wikipedia but queryable, highly structured,
                    programatically interactive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like Wolfram Language but open source, open data, and a
                    simpler interface.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The schema of this database and query interface must be
                    intuitive, and grow at a significantly slower rate than the
                    data. If the schema and interface grow in complexity equal
                    to the data - then it adds litte to no value. I'm not sure
                    if it's possible to find a schema and interface that are
                    static. I have to imagine at least in the beginning, as data
                    is added, new requirements of the schema and interface will
                    be discovered frequently.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A semi-automated or fully-automated ingestion pipeline will
                    be key to success. In comparison, Wolfram Language started
                    development over 30 years ago. There is a massive amount of
                    knowledge and it exists in an unstructured form or has a
                    different structure. My hope is that scripts and language
                    model technology can aid in the import of knowledge into the
                    system from sources like Wikipedia, academic papers, open
                    source projects, text books, and more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Large language models are in some sense type of knowledge
                    engine - just with a different architecture than imagined
                    here. LLMs are neural, stochastic, evolved via gradient
                    descent, tokens in and tokens out. This is a very powerful
                    type of knowledge engine. However, the type of knowledge
                    engine I'm talking about is more classical, built on a
                    relational/graph database, with a query interface. The
                    advantages of the classical type of knowledge engine is
                    efficiency (speed, scale, energy), structure/determinism,
                    and interpretability. The beauty is that both types of
                    knowledge engines compliment one another.

                    Cellular agriculture focuses on the production of
                    agricultural products from cell cultures using a combination
                    of biotechnology, tissue engineering, molecular biology, and
                    synthetic biology to create and design new methods of
                    producing proteins, fats, and tissues that would otherwise
                    come from traditional agriculture.[1] Most of the industry
                    is focused on animal products such as meat, milk, and eggs,
                    produced in cell culture rather than raising and
                    slaughtering farmed livestock which is associated with
                    substantial global problems of detrimental environmental
                    impacts (e.g. of meat production), animal welfare, food
                    security and human health.

                    Further scaling will require commercial production in
                    significantly larger facilities than what currently exists.
                    Scaling will also require solving an array of complex
                    challenges that will influence the cost of production. These
                    challenges span five key areas: cell lines, cell culture
                    media, bioprocess design, scaffolding, and end product
                    design and characterization.

                <h3>Rant</h3>
                <p>
                    Most programming languages drop you off the IO cliff, leave
                    you in the middle of turing complete nowhere, invoice you
                    after "it works on my machine".
                </p>
                <p>
                    We end up installing huge graphs of dependencies, some well
                    maintained, some not, some secure, some vulnerable, some
                    synergize with eachother, many don't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We end up paying for and fetching against third-party APIs
                    to do things our language cannot do, or there is no open
                    source package for, or our hardware cannot do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We end up setting up docker stacks, kubernete clusters, "App
                    Platform" stacks, insert orchestration abstraction here,
                    composed of proprietary and open source images that are
                    wired together to have some emergent behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use postgres or msql because we need persistence, it's
                    too hard to manage a database, so we use managed database
                    service in the cloud, but those managed services have bad DX
                    and are limited so we use PaaS that are wrappers over the
                    same managed service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don't test our systems - or orchestrate dependencies,
                    mocks, pipelines, headless browsers wrapped in SaaS
                    products, to give developers who don't test a reason to
                    stick to their ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some language ecosystems are better at X, don't have problem
                    Y, can do Z, can't do V, language U is better than language
                    P for B but not A, good for E but slow for anything else.
                    Language 123 is perfect and solves all problems but won't be
                    1.0 for 10 years. Language AAA solves 90% of all problems,
                    but it doesn't have any open source packages I can leech off
                    of to build an app - and I'll still be fired for using it in
                    production even if it can serve 10 billion hello world
                    requests per second.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We write our code on OS 1 but it doesn't work on OS 2, and
                    we search the internet for wrappers that will port it to
                    mobile, or we'd like to run it on an Arduino that has 2kb of
                    flash memory but a hello world has 4MB runtime overhead.

                <h3>The reality</h3>
                <p>
                    Making computers is insaley insanely
                    <em>insanely</em> complicated. Many many
                    <em>many</em> humans are needed to build one like we expect
                    today. Software is also quite complicated. Many
                    <em>many</em> humans are needed to develop the stuff we use
                    today. It is a shock that any of it works at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So many humans involved makes things even more complicated.
                    There is intrinsic complexity to computation and engineering
                    - but emergent complexity in so many humans developing the
                    technology in parallel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Standards and protocols are something we humans developed to
                    wrangle the mess. k is a protocol - a way to talk to
                    computers and for computers to talk to each other.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Humans talk to computers through characters over keys,

                        microphone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Computers talk to each other through bits over wire or
                        wave.

                        Every computer is different. Different hardware,
                        different software, different internal state, different
                        location, different connectivity.

                    <li>
                        Every human is different. Different body, different
                        cognition and behavior, different knowledge, different
                        location, different capability.

                        A computer should be aware of the knowledge,

                    i've long felt there could be a more idiomatic database for
                    javascript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    i.e. one that feels more like javascript and less an SQL

                        is very ergonomic and very performant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The bun client is based on
                        https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3 so the hope
                        is that this library can be run on nodejs too by
                        configuring an adapter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the synchronous nature of the sqlite client makes the
                        map and array operations feel like their vanilla js
                        counterpart. no promises/async/await/trycatch.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the bun node compatability api does not yet have

                    <li>
                        as an alternative to node:cluster, one can you use
                        bun.spawn and bun.serve({ reusePort: true }) to create
                        multiple bun processes that can handle requests
                        concurrently.

                    <li>
                        sqlite WAL mode allows multiple concurrent readers and
                        the writer does not block the readers.

                    <li>
                        sqlite can be easily backed up and restored because it's
                        a single file (2 files if including the WAL file which
                        is persisted on macos)

                <h4>Questions:</h4>

                    <li>
                        what are the performance/scaling characteristics? So far
                        it seems very good for most low-to-medium scale
                        applications. To help with scaling, it is easy to create
                        table partitions and even database partitions. More on
                        this to come.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        how to handle the intercept/hooks feature across
                        multiple spawned bun processes? Because the same code is
                        running on each process, the same intercept/hook code
                        will execute. It's that simple.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        how to achieve zero downtime deployments? I do not think
                        it is possible without the two container versions
                        sharing the same file system. However, I think a couple
                        minutes of downtime is acceptable especially during
                        low-traffic hours. Also, if application code is built
                        ontop a "serverless" runtime, instead of baked into the
                        container image, most deployments won't involve an
                        instance restart/swap. more on this to come.

                <h2>TCP Relay Server</h2>
                <p>Posted August 3, 2024</p>

                <p>
                    Just completed the first pass at writing a basic TCP relay
                    server "Written in Rust"™️®. Getting Rust programs to
                    compile has a similar feeling of doing a newspaper sodoku.
                    Its been a good learning experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The purpose of this tcp relay server is to eventually act as
                    a relay for replicas in a distributed pubsub cluster.
                    Replicas that receive a message from client A and need to
                    broadcast to client B that is connected to another replica
                    will broadcast the message through the relay.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Without the relay server, the replicas would need to connect
                    to each other directly, which <i>is</i> a possible
                    alternative btw.

                <p>Posted on August 1, 2024.</p>
                <p>
                    Update on August 8, 2024: I'm thinking about
                    <a href="/posts/jsolite.html">jsolite</a> instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can S3 be used in place of a database? Should S3 be used in
                    place of a database?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I saw a comment on stackoverflow "s3 wasn't designed for
                    that". Perhaps they're right, but this is just an excercise
                    at this point. If it were to work out and actually be good
                    for some situations - then fantastic! If it sucks - then I
                    know more about databases and distributed systems.
                </p>

                <h4>Notes:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each replica of the s3db server will post a file to s3
                        with it's IP address. Each replica periodically lists
                        the IPs, and inits a tcp connection to any replicas that
                        have a lesser IP than its own. This way all replicas
                        will automatically discover and connect to each other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        S3 is strongly consistent but there is no native locking
                        feature, so locking has to be implemented in the s3db
                        server logic. This is probably going to be the greatest
                        source of complexity and latency within the entire
                        system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I have some thoughts on how locking might work, but i'll
                        write more about that later.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Thought Diet</h2>
                <p>Posted on July 31, 2024. Update on August 3, 2024</p>
                <p>
                    Today I'm starting a thought diet. Here are the guidelines:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I can only think about computer stuff while I'm at the
                        computer (unless I specifically get up from the computer
                        to pace around the room over a problem)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Avoid simulating the past, future or possible realities
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Focus on smells, sounds, tastes, feelings, and entities
                        around me
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I'll keep this page updated (I think) as I go.</p>

                <p>
                    a few days later, i'm doing ok with it. I have violated the
                    first guideline several times. I give myself slack, it's a
                    longterm lifestyle goal, not a fad.
                </p>

                <p>Peace and love,</p>
